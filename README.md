# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Philippe Massicotte

As a numerical ecologist, my research interests focus on:

- Understanding how surrounding landscapes of aquatic ecosystems determine the biogeocycling of dissolved organic matter (DOM).

- Understanding how DOM, as the main agent driving the optical properties of aquatic ecosystems, influences their functioning.

- Quantifying how the complex mosaic composed of ice, snow, leads, melt ponds and open water influence underwater light regime in aquatic ecosystems.

- Understanding the influence of available irradiance under heterogeneous sea-ice conditions on phytoplankton primary production estimates.
